\section{Query Planner Information in PostgreSQL}
\label{attachment:plannerpostgresql}

Below, we can see the query planner information exposed by the \texttt{EXPLAIN} statement in PostgreSQL for a simple query selecting all theaters whose primary identifier is greater than a constant number.
We can see that the set of information returned contains a full description of the winning query plan, complete with estimated costs for each step of the plan, and the information about which indexes the query is using.

\begin{code}
EXPLAIN (FORMAT YAML) SELECT * FROM theaters WHERE id > 1010;
